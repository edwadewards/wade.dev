## Personal Website / Blog Site

I created this site to basically be my guinea pig. 
Mostly, to practice writing. I'll blog about tech topics and make occasional tutorials.
Writing about it helps me remember and if people come across it and it helps them.. even better!
Also, I'll use it to practice different techniques (particularly CSS and JS DOM) and try different design patterns.
& as I'm currently learning backend + React, I will implement those technologies as well. 
This may eventually turn into a portfolio project with writing in it.


## What I Made This With:

- HTML, SASS
