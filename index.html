        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-wave"></i> Hello fellow humans (& spam bots), my name is <strong>Wade Edwards</strong> and I am Software Developer and you, you lucky duck, have stumbled upon my blog site thingy. I made this for fun and to practice my non-existant writing skills. I'll write about tech stuff and maybe the occasional non-tech related thought that occupies my brain. So kick back, relax, and enjoy some tunes while you read my mind.</p>

          A little too much about me: When I'm not coding, many other things capture my interest, and I'll feature some of them here. But if you just came for the writing here are some of <a href="#blog">the blog posts I've written.</a>

          I currently am looking for a new developer gig but my past job was as a freelance developer & I created a site for the <a href="https://www.etrac-h.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">East Tennessee Relic & Coin Hunters</a>

        <h2 id="coding">Coding</h2>
        <p>I am a self-taught / community-taught developer. I believe in having passion for your craft and attention to detail. Currently I am a frontend and email developer but I am beginning to learn the MERN stack to become Full Stack.
          <br>
          I use Javascript, SASS & Bootstrap. CSS is really my strong suit. I took to it right away so I've been confused by the hate it gets in tech circles.

        <p>
          I try to stay in shape, I enjoy yoga, mobility training, running, and alot of just weird exercises to try to maintain and hopefully improve my athleticism. I don't enjoy strength training but I do it anyway.

        <h2 id="movies">Books, Movies & Sports</h2>
        <p>
          I really enjoy so many types of movies, it's one of the few things I'm not picky about. I like everything from the Studio Ghibli films to MCU, Harry Potter, foreign films, Star Wars & I especially love 80's cinema. 
          <br>
          I am a huge sports nerd and have been for as long as I can remember. It was truly my first love.
